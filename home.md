[![BaniGuru](http://www.namdharitruth.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BaniGuru.jpg)](http://www.namdharitruth.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BaniGuru.jpg)Namdharis have a rich heritage and have maintained many Khalsa traditions. But they have been misguided on what is most important: the identity of the One true Satguru.

The recent passing of “Satguru” Jagjit Singh has revealed a critical problem for the Namdhari Samparda. The Namdhari “Satguru” spent his final 25 days in Ludhiana’s Apollo Hospital on a ventilator and did not select a successor.

Our Namdhari brothers and sisters are now [confused ](http://www.namdharitruth.info/fallacies/who-is-the-successor-of-satguru-jagjeet-singh/)as to who is the true “Satguru”. Is it Thakur Uday Singh or Thakur Dalip Singh or Mata Chand Kaur?

It is none of the above. The true Satguru is and always will be Satguru Granth Sahib.

Gurbani tells us: ਪੇਡੁ ਮੁੰਢਾਹੂ ਕਟਿਆ ਤਿਸੁ ਡਾਲ ਸੁਕੰਦੇ ॥ meaning *When the tree is cut off at its roots, the branches wither and die.*

As the Namdhari Samparda has been cut off from the spiritual root of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, it has slowly been succumbing to incorrect practices and deviations from Sri Guru Gobind Singh’s rehit, some of which we have identified in the “Namdhari Fallacies” section of this site.

We have created this site not out of malice, but with the desire to encourage our Namdhari brothers and sisters to study the evidence. There is no doubt that the Namdhari Samparda, for all its noble qualities and glorious history, is wrong in the most fundamental of ways. They are misguided on the identity of the true Satguru.

The various articles on this site are an opportunity to initiate a dialogue and to discover the truth. If you have any questions, please free to contact us at namdharitruth@gmail.com .
