[![dhan-dhan-sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji (1)](http://www.namdharitruth.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dhan-dhan-sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji-1-300x199.jpg)](http://www.namdharitruth.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dhan-dhan-sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji-1.jpg)This website is to encourage our Namdhari brothers and sisters to ask some basic questions about their beliefs. If you are honest with yourselves, you will realize and accept that the lineage of Namdhari “Gurus” is neither historically, logically nor spiritually supportable. There is no doubt that Sri Guru Gobind Singh appointed Sri Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal Satguru of the Khalsa Panth.

The Namdhari samparda started as a revolution against the corrupt practices in the Panth. Baba Ram Singh was an exemplary Gursikh who will be remembered as a role model. The Namdhari family has preserved many important Khalsa traditions, whether it is kirtan maryada, the tradition of sodh, simple living and dress as well as a strong focus on amrit vela, naam simran and Gurbani.

But without faith in the true Satguru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib, all of this is for not.

There is no alternative but to accept Sri Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal Guru of the Khalsa.

There have been many Namdharis who have accepted Sri Guru Granth Sahib and become well known in the Khalsa Panth like [Bhai Surjan Singh and Bibi Joginder Kaur](http://www.angelfire.com/theforce/khalsa/bibijoginderkaur.html). We would encourage our Namdhari brothers and sisters to come back into the mainstream Khalsa fold. It is not too late. The Neeldhari samparada which originated from the Namdharis recently came back. You too can return and bring with you a revival of the traditions that you have preserved.

Embrace the truth and recognize your true origins. Rejoin your brothers and sisters in the Khalsa.
