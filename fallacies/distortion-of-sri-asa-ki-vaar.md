Baba Ram Rai distorted just one word in Sri Asa Ki Vaar in his conversation with Aurganzeb. Instead of reciting ਮਿਟੀ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਕੀ ਪੇੜੈ ਪਈ ਕੁਮ੍ਹ੍ਹਿਆਰ ॥ he instead said “bayeeman”. As a result, Sri Guru Har Rai declared that he was bemukh and should not come before him again.

Sadly, our Namdhari brothers and sisters make the grave mistake of distorting Sri Asa Ki Vaar every day. Instead of reciting ਨੀਲ ਬਸਤ੍ਰ ਲੇ ਕਪੜੇ ਪਹਿਰੇ ਤੁਰਕ ਪਠਾਣੀ ਅਮਲੁ ਕੀਆ ॥ they instead sing “Nil bastar le kapre phare; Turk Pathani amal gaya”.

They claim this is because Sri Guru Gobind Singh changed the tuk while burning his blue clothes after leaving Machhiwara.

The truth is that this distorted tuk does not appear in even ONE saroop of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. None of the historical saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib have recorded such a change. If indeed Sri Guru Gobind Singh did make this change, it would have appeared in some of the subsequent recensions, but it does not.
